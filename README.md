After creating a landing page, you can view it (and all your other pages) in "My Pages" page in the navigation bar
above.  
 There you have a link to the page you created and a link to the contacts page - a page with a table containing all of your
contacts information (details left in the contact form of a landing page). You may also delete or update each landing page.
